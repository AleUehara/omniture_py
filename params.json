{"name":"Omniture_py","body":"Omniture_Py\r\n===========\r\nA Python Library To Access Omniture's SiteCatalyst Reporting API\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis library simplifies the process of accessing the Omniture SiteCatalyst Reporting API by wrapping the REST API calls in a Python library.\r\n\r\nFirst, get access configured by reading through documentation at [Omniture Developer Connection](http://developer.omniture.com/).  Then, to test authentication/access:  \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport omniture_py  \r\nompy = OmniturePy('username:company','shared_secret')     \r\njson_object =  ompy.run_omtr_immediate_request('Company.GetReportSuites', '')  \r\nfor suite in json_object[\"report_suites\"]: \r\n    print \"Report Suite ID: %s\\nSite Title: %s\\n\" % (suite[\"rsid\"], suite[\"site_title\"])  \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get total number of page views yesterday, just run the following.  It runs an <b>Overtime</b> report in SiteCatalyst, with <b>pageViews</b> as the metric, and returns the numeric total result.  \r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint ompy.get_count_from_report('report_suite_name', 'pageViews') \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get number of page views for \"Homepage\" and \"Media Guide\" combined, yesterday, run the following.  It runs a <b>Trended</b> report in SiteCatalyst, using <b>pageViews</b> as the metric, and 'page' as the Element, and then selecting for pages titled either \"Homepage\" or \"Media Guide\":  \r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint ompy.get_count_from_report('report_suite_name', 'pageViews', 'page', [\"Homepage\",\"Media Guide\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe get_count_from_report function currently supports requesting one dimension (called an 'element') in addition to the date, which is always implied to be included.  It also only currently supports requesting one metric at a time.  If you wish to have lower-level access to the Omniture API than this, you can just use the run_omtr_queue_and_wait_request, and pass it the type of request and full request body.  This will return a Python object.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nobj = ompy.run_omtr_queue_and_wait_request('Report.QueueTrended', {\"reportDescription\" : reportDescription})\r\n```\r\n\t\r\nFull documentation on each of the parameters available to these methods can be found within the code.","tagline":"Python SDK For The Omniture SiteCatalyst API","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
